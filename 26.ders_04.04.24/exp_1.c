C divides the operators into the following groups:

    Arithmetic operators
    Assignment operators
    Comparison operators
    Logical operators
    Bitwise operators

/*
Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
Operator 	Name 	        Description 	                            Example 	Try it
+ 	        Addition 	    Adds together two values 	                x + y
- 	        Subtraction 	Subtracts one value from another 	        x - y
* 	        Multiplication 	Multiplies two values                   	x * y
/ 	        Division 	    Divides one value by another 	            x / y
% 	        Modulus 	    Returns the division remainder              x % y
++ 	        Increment 	    Increases the value of a variable by 1  	++x
-- 	        Decrement 	    Decreases the value of a variable by 1  	--x

/*
Assignment operators

A list of all assignment operators:
Operator 	Example 	Same As
= 	        x = 5 	    x = 5
+= 	        x += 3 	    x = x + 3
-= 	        x -= 3 	    x = x - 3
*=      	x *= 3  	x = x * 3
/=      	x /= 3  	x = x / 3
%= 	        x %= 3  	x = x % 3
&= 	        x &= 3  	x = x & 3
|= 	        x |= 3  	x = x | 3
^= 	        x ^= 3  	x = x ^ 3
>>=        	x >>= 3 	x = x >> 3
<<= 	    x <<= 3 	x = x << 3
